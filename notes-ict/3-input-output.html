  <!-- Input Devices -->
  <h3 class="note-subtitle">Input Devices</h3>
  <p class="note-paragraph">
    Input devices are hardware components used to send data and instructions to
    a computer for processing. They allow users to interact with the system
    effectively.
  </p>
  <ul class="note-list">
    <li>
      <strong>Keyboard:</strong> Standard QWERTY keyboards, mechanical
      keyboards, virtual keyboards, and ergonomic variants used for text input.
      Includes function keys, control keys, and numeric keypad.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Mouse:</strong> Pointing device that detects two-dimensional
      motion to control the cursor on screen. Types include optical, laser, and
      trackball mice.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Pointing Devices:</strong> Trackpads, styluses, touchscreens, and
      joysticks for precise navigation and control.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Voice Input:</strong> Microphones and speech recognition systems
      that convert spoken words into digital data.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Scanners:</strong> Devices that convert physical documents or
      images into digital form, including flatbed, sheet-fed, and handheld
      scanners.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Specialized Input:</strong> Dedicated devices for specific
      purposes, such as barcode readers, magnetic card readers, and biometric
      devices.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <!-- Output Devices -->
  <h3 class="note-subtitle">Output Devices</h3>
  <p class="note-paragraph">
    Output devices are hardware components that present data from the computer
    to the user in a readable or usable form.
  </p>
  <ul class="note-list">
    <li>
      <strong>Monitors:</strong> Display devices that show visual output. Types
      include CRT, LCD, LED, OLED, and touch-sensitive displays.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Printers:</strong> Produce hard copies of digital documents. Types
      include inkjet, laser, dot matrix, and 3D printers.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Speakers and Headphones:</strong> Audio output devices for sound
      reproduction.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Plotters:</strong> Specialized printers for high-quality vector

      large screens for presentations or entertainment.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <!-- Combined Function Devices -->
  <h3 class="note-subtitle">Input & Output Combined</h3>
  <p class="note-paragraph">
    Some devices perform both input and output functions:
  </p>
  <ul class="note-list">
    <li>
      <strong>Touchscreen Monitors:</strong> Accept user input directly while
      displaying output.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Multifunction Printers:</strong> Print, scan, and copy functions
      combined.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Interactive Whiteboards:</strong> Used in classrooms and offices
      for collaborative input and output.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <!-- Summary -->
  <h3 class="note-subtitle">Summary</h3>
  <p class="note-paragraph">
    Input and output devices are essential for human-computer interaction.
    Proper selection of these devices depends on the application, efficiency,
    accuracy, and ease of use. With advancements in technology, many devices now
