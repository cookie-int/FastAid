  <!-- Introduction -->
  <h3 class="note-subtitle">Introduction</h3>
  <p class="note-paragraph">
    An information system relies not only on hardware and software but also on
    <strong>networks</strong> and <strong>people</strong> to function
    effectively. Networks enable data transmission, while people interact with
    the system to input data, make decisions, and analyze information.
  </p>

  <!-- Networks -->
  <h3 class="note-subtitle">Networks</h3>
  <p class="note-paragraph">
    Networks are the infrastructure that connects computers, devices, and users.
    They allow data to flow between different parts of the system, and between
    external systems or users.
  </p>
  <ul class="note-list">
    <li>
      <strong>Types of Networks:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>LAN (Local Area Network):</strong> Covers a small area like an
          office or campus.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>WAN (Wide Area Network):</strong> Connects multiple LANs
          across cities or countries.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Internet:</strong> Global network connecting millions of
          computers worldwide.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Transmission Methods:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Wired:</strong> Fiber optic cables, coaxial cables.</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Wireless:</strong> Radio waves, microwaves, Wi-Fi, mobile
          networks.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Protocols:</strong> Set of rules that govern communication, e.g.,
      TCP/IP.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <!-- People -->
  <h3 class="note-subtitle">People</h3>
  <p class="note-paragraph">
    People are the most important component of an information system. They
    interact with the system, provide inputs, and use outputs to make decisions.
    Feedback from users also helps improve system performance.
  </p>
  <ul class="note-list">
    <li>
      <strong>End Users:</strong> Use applications to perform tasks and generate
      outputs.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>IT Staff:</strong> Manage and maintain hardware, software, and
      networks.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Analysts:</strong> Interpret system data to support
      decision-making.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Managers:</strong> Use information to plan and oversee operations.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <!-- Synergy of Networks & People -->
  <h3 class="note-subtitle">Synergy of Networks and People</h3>
  <p class="note-paragraph">
    The combination of networks and people allows an information system to:
  </p>
  <ul class="note-list">
    <li>Transmit data quickly and reliably across devices and locations.</li>
    <li>Enable collaboration and communication among users.</li>
    <li>Support decision-making through timely information access.</li>
    <li>Continuously improve system functionality via feedback.</li>
  </ul>

  <!-- Summary -->
  <h3 class="note-subtitle">Summary</h3>
  <p class="note-paragraph">
    Networks provide the connectivity needed for data flow, while people provide
    intelligence, decision-making, and feedback. Together, they ensure that an
    information system is functional, efficient, and useful.
