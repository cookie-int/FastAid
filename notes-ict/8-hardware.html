  <!-- Introduction -->
  <h3 class="note-subtitle">Introduction</h3>
  <p class="note-paragraph">
    Hardware refers to the <strong>physical components</strong> of an
    information system. These are the devices you can physically touch, such as
    computers, storage drives, input/output devices, and networking equipment.
    Hardware forms the backbone of any information system, enabling data to be
    processed, stored, and transmitted.
  </p>

  <!-- Components of Hardware -->
  <h3 class="note-subtitle">Main Components</h3>
  <ul class="note-list">
    <li>
      <strong>Computers:</strong> Desktop PCs, laptops, servers, and tablets
      that process and store data.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Storage Devices:</strong> Hard disks, solid-state drives (SSDs),
      and cloud storage that retain information for short or long term.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Input Devices:</strong> Keyboards, mice, scanners, and
      touchscreens that allow users to enter data into the system.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Output Devices:</strong> Monitors, printers, and speakers that
      display or convey processed information to users.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Networking Devices:</strong> Routers, switches, and modems that
      enable communication between devices and across networks.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <!-- Modern Hardware -->
  <h3 class="note-subtitle">Modern Considerations</h3>
  <p class="note-paragraph">
    Today, hardware is not limited to physical devices in the office. Cloud
    computing allows storage and computing resources to exist virtually,
    accessible through the internet. This reduces dependency on local machines,
    improves scalability, and enables remote access to information systems.
  </p>

  <!-- Importance of Hardware -->
  <h3 class="note-subtitle">Importance of Hardware in an Information System</h3>
  <ul class="note-list">
    <li>
      Provides the physical platform for software to run and users to interact
      with data.
    </li>
    <li>Enables high-speed processing and storage of information.</li>
    <li>
      Supports networking and communication within and outside the organization.
    </li>
    <li>
      Forms the foundation for future technology upgrades and system expansion.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <!-- Summary -->
  <h3 class="note-subtitle">Summary</h3>
  <p class="note-paragraph">
    Hardware is the tangible part of an information system that allows data
    processing, storage, and communication. A strong, well-maintained hardware
    infrastructure ensures that software and data function efficiently and
    reliably.
