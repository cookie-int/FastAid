  <!-- Introduction -->
  <h3 class="note-subtitle">Introduction</h3>
  <p class="note-paragraph">
    The machine cycle is the fundamental operational process of a computer’s
    CPU. It describes how the CPU fetches, decodes, executes, and stores
    instructions. Understanding the machine cycle is essential for comprehending
    how computers process data efficiently.
  </p>

  <!-- Step 1: Fetch -->
  <h3 class="note-subtitle">Step 1: Fetch</h3>
  <p class="note-paragraph">
    In the fetch step, the CPU reads an instruction from the main memory (RAM)
    and temporarily stores it in the Control Unit (CU). This prepares the CPU
    for processing the instruction.
  </p>
  <ul class="note-list">
    <li>
      The instruction is retrieved from memory based on the Program Counter
      (PC).
    </li>
    <li>Ensures the next instruction is ready for execution.</li>
  </ul>

  <!-- Step 2: Decode -->
  <h3 class="note-subtitle">Step 2: Decode</h3>
  <p class="note-paragraph">
    During decoding, the Control Unit interprets the fetched instruction and
    converts it into signals. These signals instruct other CPU components what
    operations to perform.
  </p>
  <ul class="note-list">
    <li>
      Determines whether the instruction involves arithmetic, logic, or data
      transfer.
    </li>
    <li>Prepares the ALU, registers, or other units for execution.</li>
  </ul>

  <!-- Step 3: Execute -->
  <h3 class="note-subtitle">Step 3: Execute</h3>
  <p class="note-paragraph">
    In the execution step, the CPU performs the operation as instructed. The
    Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) handles calculations or logical operations.
  </p>
  <ul class="note-list">
    <li>Examples: Addition, subtraction, comparisons, or data transfer.</li>
    <li>The result of the operation is generated in this step.</li>
  </ul>

  <!-- Step 4: Store -->
  <h3 class="note-subtitle">Step 4: Store</h3>
  <p class="note-paragraph">
    The store step writes the result produced by the CPU back to memory or a
    register, making it available for future use by programs or users.
  </p>
  <ul class="note-list">
    <li>
      Completes one full machine cycle before the next instruction begins.
    </li>
    <li>Ensures that results are preserved and accessible.</li>
  </ul>

  <!-- Summary -->
  <h3 class="note-subtitle">Summary</h3>
  <p class="note-paragraph">
    The machine cycle consists of four steps:
    <strong>Fetch, Decode, Execute, and Store</strong>. This cycle repeats
    continuously, enabling the CPU to process instructions efficiently.
    Understanding the machine cycle is key to grasping how computers execute
    programs.
