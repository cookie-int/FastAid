      <!-- Introduction -->
      <h3 class="note-subtitle">Introduction</h3>
      <p class="note-paragraph">
        The <strong>Binary Number System</strong> is a
        <strong>base 2</strong> system used by computers to represent data. It
        uses only two symbols: <strong>0</strong> and <strong>1</strong>, which
        are called <strong>bits</strong> (binary digits).
      </p>

      <!-- Importance -->
      <h3 class="note-subtitle">Importance in Computing</h3>
      <p class="note-paragraph">
        Computers operate using electrical signals that can be ON or OFF, which
        perfectly maps to 1s and 0s. Every operation, data, and instruction in a
        computer is ultimately represented in binary.
      </p>

      <!-- Structure -->
      <h3 class="note-subtitle">Structure of Binary Numbers</h3>
      <p class="note-paragraph">
        Each digit in a binary number has a <strong>place value</strong> based
        on powers of 2.
      </p>
      <ul class="note-list">
        <li>Example: Binary number <strong>1011</strong></li>
        <li>Digit 1 → 2³ → 1 × 8 = 8</li>
        <li>Digit 0 → 2² → 0 × 4 = 0</li>
        <li>Digit 1 → 2¹ → 1 × 2 = 2</li>
        <li>Digit 1 → 2⁰ → 1 × 1 = 1</li>
        <li>Total = 8 + 0 + 2 + 1 = 11 in decimal</li>
      </ul>

      <!-- Conversion to Decimal -->
      <h3 class="note-subtitle">Binary to Decimal Conversion</h3>
      <p class="note-paragraph">
        To convert binary to decimal, multiply each bit by 2 raised to the power
        of its position (starting from 0 on the right) and sum the results.
      </p>

      <!-- Summary -->
      <h3 class="note-subtitle">Summary</h3>
      <p class="note-paragraph">
        Binary numbers form the foundation of all computer operations.
        Understanding binary is essential for learning about data
        representation, arithmetic operations, and conversions to other number
        systems like octal, decimal, and hexadecimal.
