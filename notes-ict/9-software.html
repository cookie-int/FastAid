  <!-- Introduction -->
  <h3 class="note-subtitle">Introduction</h3>
  <p class="note-paragraph">
    Software is the <strong>intangible component</strong> of an information
    system. It provides the instructions that allow hardware to process data,
    perform tasks, and deliver results. Without software, hardware would be
    unable to function.
  </p>

  <!-- Types of Software -->
  <h3 class="note-subtitle">Types of Software</h3>
  <ul class="note-list">
    <li>
      <strong>System Software:</strong> Programs that manage and control
      hardware resources. Examples include operating systems like
      <strong>Windows</strong>, <strong>Linux</strong>, and
      <strong>macOS</strong>. System software provides a platform for running
      application software.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Application Software:</strong> Programs designed to perform
      specific tasks for users. Examples include
      <strong>Microsoft Excel</strong> (data analysis),
      <strong>PowerPoint</strong> (presentations), and
      <strong>Photoshop</strong> (image editing). Application software helps
      users accomplish practical objectives efficiently.

  </ul>

  <!-- Role of Software -->
  <h3 class="note-subtitle">Role of Software in Information Systems</h3>
  <ul class="note-list">
    <li>
      Translates user commands into instructions that hardware can execute.
    </li>
    <li>Facilitates data input, processing, storage, and output.</li>
    <li>Ensures the system operates efficiently and securely.</li>
    <li>Enables automation of complex tasks and enhances productivity.</li>
    <li>
      Supports decision-making by providing tools for analysis and
      visualization.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <!-- Modern Trends in Software -->
  <h3 class="note-subtitle">Modern Trends</h3>
  <p class="note-paragraph">
    Modern software extends beyond desktops to
    <strong>web-based applications</strong>, <strong>mobile apps</strong>, and
    <strong>cloud computing services</strong>. Integration with artificial
    intelligence and machine learning allows software to provide predictive
    insights, automation, and improved user experiences.

  <!-- Summary -->
  <h3 class="note-subtitle">Summary</h3>
  <p class="note-paragraph">
    Software is the brain of an information system, instructing hardware on how
    to perform tasks. A combination of system and application software allows
    users to interact with hardware, process data, and achieve meaningful
    outcomes.
