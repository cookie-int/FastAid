  <h2 class="note-title">Storage Devices</h2>

  <!-- Introduction -->
  <h3 class="note-subtitle">Introduction</h3>
  <p class="note-paragraph">
    Storage devices are hardware components used to store data and instructions
    in a computer.
    <br /><br />
    They are divided into two main types:
  </p>
  <ul class="note-list">
    <li>
      <strong>Primary Storage:</strong> Fast, volatile memory directly accessed
      by the CPU.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Secondary Storage:</strong> Slower, non-volatile memory used for
      long-term storage.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <!-- Primary Storage -->
  <h3 class="note-subtitle">Primary Storage</h3>
  <p class="note-paragraph">
    Primary storage is used to hold data and instructions that the CPU is
    currently using. It is fast but usually loses its data when power is turned
    off.
  </p>
  <ul class="note-list">
    <li>
      <strong>RAM (Random Access Memory):</strong> Temporary storage for data
      and programs in use.
      <ul>
        <li>DRAM: Needs regular refresh; commonly used in computers.</li>
        <li>SRAM: Faster and more expensive; used in CPU cache.</li>
        <li>
          <em>Example:</em> When opening a browser, websites load into RAM for
          fast access.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>ROM (Read-Only Memory):</strong> Non-volatile memory containing
      firmware, essential for booting.
      <ul>
        <li>PROM: Programmed once after manufacturing.</li>
        <li>EPROM: Can be erased with UV light and reprogrammed.</li>
        <li>
          EEPROM: Electrically erasable and rewritable; used for BIOS updates.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>Example:</em> BIOS instructions stored in ROM help the computer
          start up.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Cache Memory:</strong> High-speed memory between CPU and RAM that
      stores frequently used data for faster access. <br /><em>Example:</em>
      Game textures stored in cache for quicker rendering.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Registers:</strong> Tiny, ultra-fast storage inside the CPU for
      immediate calculations and instructions. <br /><em>Example:</em> Storing
      results of arithmetic operations temporarily.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <!-- Secondary Storage -->
  <h3 class="note-subtitle">Secondary Storage</h3>
  <p class="note-paragraph">
    Secondary storage provides long-term data retention. It has higher capacity
    than primary memory but is slower.
  </p>
  <ul class="note-list">
    <li>
      <strong>Hard Disk Drives (HDDs):</strong> Magnetic storage with spinning
      disks. Large capacity, low cost. <br /><em>Example:</em> Storing your
      documents, applications, and media files.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Solid State Drives (SSDs):</strong> Flash-based, faster and more
      durable than HDDs. <br /><em>Example:</em> Booting the operating system in
      seconds.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Optical Discs:</strong> CDs, DVDs, Blu-ray; read and written using
      lasers. <br /><em>Example:</em> Installing software or watching movies.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>USB Flash Drives:</strong> Portable storage for transferring files
      between computers. <br /><em>Example:</em> Moving assignments to another
      PC.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>RAID Systems:</strong> Multiple drives combined for speed or
      redundancy. <br /><em>Example:</em> RAID 1 mirrors data for backup; RAID 0
      stripes data for faster access.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <!-- Summary -->
  <h3 class="note-subtitle">Summary</h3>
  <p class="note-paragraph">
    Storage devices are crucial for both temporary and permanent data
    management.
    <br /><br />
    Primary memory ensures speed for active processes, while secondary memory
    provides long-term retention. Most modern systems use a mix of both to
    balance performance, cost, and capacity.
