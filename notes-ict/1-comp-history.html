  <!-- Early Computing Devices -->
  <h3 class="note-subtitle" style="color:#1c6dd0;">Early Computing Devices</h3>
  <p class="note-paragraph">
    The journey of computing began with simple calculation tools. 
    <strong>Abacus</strong> was one of the first devices for arithmetic operations. 
    Later, mechanical calculators were developed by <strong>Pascal (France)</strong> and <strong>Leibniz (Germany)</strong>.
    Charles <strong>Babbage</strong> designed machines using gears and <strong>punch cards</strong> to store algorithms and output results.

  <!-- Electromechanical Machines -->
  <h3 class="note-subtitle" style="color:#1c6dd0;">Electromechanical Machines</h3>
  <p class="note-paragraph">
    Gear-based machines were slow, costly, and hard to maintain. 
    The solution was <strong>Electromechanical Relays</strong>, which could represent binary logic.
  </p>
  <p class="note-paragraph">
    <strong>Relays:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Electricity flows → Relay ON = 1</li>
      <li>No electricity → Relay OFF = 0</li>
    </ul>
    Using relays allowed faster and cheaper computation compared to gear mechanisms.
  </p>
  <p class="note-paragraph">
    Notable implementations include:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Stibitz (1940)</strong> at Bell Labs</li>
      <li><strong>Harvard Mark-I (1944)</strong></li>
    </ul>
