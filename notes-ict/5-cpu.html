  <!-- Introduction -->
  <h3 class="note-subtitle">Introduction</h3>
  <p class="note-paragraph">
    The <strong>CPU</strong> is the brain of the computer. It performs all the
    calculations, executes instructions, and manages data flow between other
    hardware components. <br /><br />
    Every computer requires a CPU to function, as it interprets and executes
    program instructions.
  </p>

  <!-- Components of CPU -->
  <h3 class="note-subtitle">Components of CPU</h3>
  <ul class="note-list">
    <li>
      <strong>Control Unit (CU):</strong> Directs the operation of the CPU and
      other components by fetching, decoding, and executing instructions.
      <br /><em>Example:</em> CU decides whether data goes to memory, I/O
      devices, or ALU.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU):</strong> Performs all arithmetic
      (addition, subtraction) and logical (AND, OR, NOT) operations. <br /><em
        >Example:</em
      >
      ALU calculates 2+2 or compares two numbers to check which is larger.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Registers:</strong> Small, ultra-fast storage units inside the CPU
      used to temporarily hold data, instructions, and addresses. <br /><em
        >Example:</em
      >
      Holding the result of a calculation before storing it in memory.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Cache Memory:</strong> High-speed memory close to the CPU that
      stores frequently used data for quick access. <br /><em>Example:</em>
      Temporary storage of recently used instructions for faster execution.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <!-- CPU Functions -->
  <h3 class="note-subtitle">Functions of CPU</h3>
  <ul class="note-list">
    <li><strong>Fetch:</strong> Retrieves instructions from memory.</li>
    <li>
      <strong>Decode:</strong> Interprets the instruction to understand required
      operations.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Execute:</strong> Performs arithmetic, logical, or control
      operations as directed.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Store:</strong> Writes results back to memory or registers.</li>
  </ul>

  <!-- Types of CPU -->
  <h3 class="note-subtitle">Types of CPU</h3>
  <ul class="note-list">
    <li>
      <strong>Single-Core CPU:</strong> Has one processing unit; handles one
      instruction at a time.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Multi-Core CPU:</strong> Multiple processing units on a single
      chip; can handle multiple instructions simultaneously.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Embedded CPU:</strong> Found in devices like smartphones, washing
      machines, and IoT gadgets; optimized for specific tasks.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <!-- Summary -->
  <h3 class="note-subtitle">Summary</h3>
  <p class="note-paragraph">
    The CPU is the central hub of computing. Its performance affects the overall
    speed and efficiency of a computer. Understanding its components, functions,
    and types helps in grasping how computers execute programs and manage data.
