  <!-- Introduction -->
  <h3 class="note-subtitle">Introduction</h3>
  <p class="note-paragraph">
    Computers understand instructions through
    <strong>computer languages</strong>, which allow humans to communicate tasks
    to the CPU. <br /><br />
    These languages vary in complexity, from machine-level code to high-level
    AI-based languages.
  </p>

  <!-- Machine Language -->
  <h3 class="note-subtitle">1. Machine Language</h3>
  <p class="note-paragraph">
    <strong>Description:</strong> Binary code (0s and 1s) directly understood by
    the CPU.<br />
    <strong>Example:</strong> 10110011 (each combination represents an
    instruction)<br />
    <strong>Note:</strong> Fast for the computer, but very difficult for humans
    to write or debug.
  </p>

  <!-- Assembly Language -->
  <h3 class="note-subtitle">2. Assembly Language</h3>
  <p class="note-paragraph">
    <strong>Description:</strong> Low-level language using mnemonic codes
    instead of binary.<br />
    <strong>Example:</strong> MOV A, B (moves data from register B to A)<br />
    <strong>Note:</strong> Easier than machine language but still requires
    detailed knowledge of hardware.
  </p>

  <!-- High-Level Language -->
  <h3 class="note-subtitle">3. High-Level Language</h3>
  <p class="note-paragraph">
    <strong>Description:</strong> Closer to human language, easier to read and
    write.<br />
    <strong>Examples:</strong> C, C++, Java, Python<br />
    <strong>Note:</strong> Requires a compiler or interpreter to translate into
    machine code.
  </p>

  <!-- Fourth-Generation Language -->
  <h3 class="note-subtitle">4. Fourth-Generation Language (4GL)</h3>
  <p class="note-paragraph">
    <strong>Description:</strong> Very close to natural language, mainly used
    for databases and report generation.<br />
    <strong>Examples:</strong> SQL, MATLAB<br />
    <strong>Note:</strong> Reduces coding time, commonly used in business and
    data applications.
  </p>

  <!-- Fifth-Generation Language -->
  <h3 class="note-subtitle">5. Fifth-Generation Language (5GL)</h3>
  <p class="note-paragraph">
    <strong>Description:</strong> Based on artificial intelligence and
    problem-solving constraints.<br />
    <strong>Examples:</strong> Prolog, LISP<br />
    <strong>Note:</strong> Focuses on solving problems rather than manually
    coding procedures.
  </p>

  <!-- Summary -->
  <h3 class="note-subtitle">Summary</h3>
  <p class="note-paragraph">
    Computer languages bridge humans and machines. Lower-level languages provide
    control over hardware, while high-level and AI-based languages improve
    readability and efficiency.
